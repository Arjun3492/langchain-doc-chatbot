1. What is ReactJS?
   - ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications, using reusable UI components. It was developed by Facebook.

2. What are the main features of ReactJS?
   - JSX (JavaScript XML) syntax
   - Virtual DOM
   - Component-based architecture
   - One-way data binding
   - High performance

3. What is JSX?
   - JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to XML or HTML and is used with React to describe what the UI should look like.

4. What is the Virtual DOM?
   - The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM. It allows React to update the DOM efficiently by only re-rendering parts of the UI that have changed.

5. What is a React component?
   - A React component is a reusable piece of UI that can have its own state and props. Components can be either class-based or functional.

6. What is the difference between a functional component and a class component?
   - Functional components are stateless and are defined as plain JavaScript functions. Class components are stateful and are defined as ES6 classes.

7. What are props in React?
   - Props (short for properties) are read-only inputs passed from a parent component to a child component. They allow data to flow from parent to child components.

8. What is state in React?
   - State is a built-in object that allows components to create and manage their own data. State is mutable and can change over time, triggering re-renders of the component.

9. How do you update the state of a component?
   - State in a React component is updated using the `setState` method in class components or the `useState` hook in functional components.

10. What is the purpose of the `useEffect` hook?
    - The `useEffect` hook allows you to perform side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.

11. What is a Higher-Order Component (HOC)?
    - A Higher-Order Component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with added functionality.

12. What is the Context API?
    - The Context API is a way to share values between components without having to explicitly pass props through every level of the component tree.

13. What are React hooks?
    - Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Examples include `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`.

14. What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?
    - Controlled components have their form data controlled by React state. Uncontrolled components store their own state internally using refs.

15. What is the purpose of keys in React lists?
    - Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. They should be unique and stable for each item in a list.

16. What is React Router?
    - React Router is a library for managing navigation and routing in React applications. It allows you to define routes and handle navigation between different components.

17. What is Redux?
    - Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications, often used with React. It provides a centralized store for application state and predictable state management through actions and reducers.

18. How do you handle events in React?
    - Events in React are handled using event handlers. These are typically defined as methods in class components or functions in functional components and passed as props.

19. What is the purpose of the `useReducer` hook?
    - The `useReducer` hook is an alternative to `useState` for managing complex state logic. It takes a reducer function and an initial state and returns the current state and a dispatch function.

20. How do you optimize performance in React applications?
    - Performance optimization in React can be achieved through techniques like memoization with `React.memo`, using the `useMemo` and `useCallback` hooks, code splitting, and lazy loading components.
